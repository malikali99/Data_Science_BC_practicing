# Variables Pros
# 1. It reduces the human effort for coding
# 2. Easy to write for long datasets.
# 3. Easy to recall

# Strategy
# 1. Only those jo python ki apni zuban main nahi ha. un ko variables ni banana jo python ka reserve words hon
# Assignment: Python ka reserve words kon kon sa hain jo hum na python ma use ni krna?: 
# 2. The reserve words are None, not ,assert, for ,while, and ,as ,and, else, if ,elif etcc..
# 2. Don't ever write variables names with spaces instead use underscores(_)
# 3. capitalize na karen (Because it is case sensitive)
# 4. Don't write big long letter of variables use short words (Max used 2 wors..)
# 5. Don't Start with special character or number in variables at the beginning. like 2, 3, $% etc 
# 6. Meaningful hona chahye apka variable like kashti ki jaga ap us ko cycle keh dain
# 7. always see global trends like (df=dataframe)
# 8. Don't ever repeat the same variable (pehla wala update ho jana ha phir)
# 9. How we deal with nameing convension
# 10. Ap na opearators use ni krna variables ma like +,-,*,% etc

# Now start practicing


# x = (2+3-3*4+(3/4))
# print(x)
# # OR
# x = (2+3-3*4(3/4)) # check why is there is an error
# print(x)

# fruit_basket=("Apple","banana","pineapple","pear","peach","mangoe")
# print(fruit_basket)

# Tuples:
# Collection of string is called tuples like ("malik","ali","husnain","safdar")

# type casting
x = "15"
print(type(x))
print(x)
x = int(x)
print(type(x))
print(x)
